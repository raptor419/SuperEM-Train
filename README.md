# SuperEM

Over the past few years, the resolutions of the maps solved by Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) have largely improved. 
Although computational protein structure modelling tools perform better as the resolution improves, 
de novo modelling of the structures still has limitations when the EM map resolution is worse than 4 Å. 
We report SuperEM, a novel 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based method to generate super-resolution EM map by taking an experimental EM map as input. 


## About SuperEM  


SuperEM is a 3D deep learning based super-resolution method which uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to improve the resolution of cryo-EM maps in the resolution ranges of 3 Å to 6 Å.
GAN architecture of SuperEM is shown below.
